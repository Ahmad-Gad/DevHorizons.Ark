# DevHorizons.Ark
Ark is a powerfull SDK for fast coding with extensive extension and static methods implemented to save time for developers.
Those methods include:
1. Smart Converting methods using smart reflection to identify the source and target types and attempts to do the conversion with safe way.
2. String manipulation/parsing.
3. Validation and comparission methods.
4. Lot of reflection implementation to control and access all the members of objects and types.
And much more.

The SDK has intensive unit testing and code coverage plus benchmark validations for the best performance.

The SDK is under optimization and refactoring and not ready to be used for now.
